MC/DC is an open-source, Python-based Monte Carlo radiation transport code that
combines rapid methods development with scalable, high-performance execution on
modern computing systems. Originally initiated by the Center for Exascale
Monte Carlo Neutron Transport ([CEMeNT](https://cement-psaap.github.io/)), MC/DC
development is now led by the Center for Advancing the Radiation Resilience of
Electronics ([CARRE](https://carre-psaapiv.org/)).

## Features

- Monte Carlo neutron transport (with photon and charged-particle capabilities
  under development)
- Time-dependent, steady-state, and eigenvalue simulations
- Multiple physics fidelities (continuous-energy/multi-group,
  single-scattering/condensed-history)
- Distributed-memory parallel execution with MPI
- Machine-portable Python implementation accelerated by Numba JIT compilation
- Extensible architecture for rapid methods development and prototyping

## Installation

Install the latest stable release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install mcdc
```
