MC/DC is an open-source, Python-based Monte Carlo radiation transport code that combines rapid methods development with scalable, high-performance execution on modern computing systems.
Originally initiated by the Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport ([CEMeNT](https://cement-psaap.github.io/)), MC/DC development is now led by the Center for Advancing the Radiation Resilience of Electronics ([CARRE](https://carre-psaapiv.org/)).

## Features

- Monte Carlo neutron transport, with photon and charged-particle transport and coupled multi-particle capabilities under development
- Time-dependent, steady-state, and eigenvalue simulations
- Multiple physics fidelities (e.g., continuous-energy and multigroup neutron transport, with single-scattering and condensed-history charged-particle transport under development)
- Distributed-memory parallel execution with MPI
- Machine-portable Python implementation accelerated by Numba JIT compilation
- Extensible architecture for prototyping new transport methods

## Installation

MC/DC requires Python 3.11 or newer.

Install the latest stable release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install mcdc
```

For development installation and additional options, see the [Installation Guide](https://mcdc.readthedocs.io/en/dev/user_guide/getting_started/installation.html).
