### Fixed

- Docker compatibility issue from [@melekderman]

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-12

This release marks the final development phase under CEMeNT and the beginning of development under CARRE. A significant refactor was completed to improve ease of use, maintainability, and extensibility, restructuring the codebase to support future features and capabilities.

Major refactoring included:

- implementation of `code_factory`, which generates Numba- and GPU-compatible data structures from Python class objects; and
- reorganization of functions into a module-based architecture with well-defined interfaces.

GPU support is currently being updated to match the refactored architecture. The pre-refactor implementation, available in the `cement` branch, retains full GPU support. Complete GPU support for the refactored codebase (including both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs) is targeted for v0.15.0 or v0.16.0.

### Added

- `code_factory` from [@ilhamv]
- ACEtk-based data library generator from [@ilhamv]
- Multi-particle transport and physics model interfaces from [@ilhamv]
- ACE-based continuous-energy neutron physics from [@ilhamv]
- Element data library for electron transport from [@melekderman]
- Single-scattering electron transport from [@melekderman]
- Axis-aligned torus surfaces from [@Talen-Ayers]
- General cylinder surface from [@melekderman]
- Axis-aligned cone surfaces from [@melekderman]
- Docker support from [@melekderman]
- Pull request and issue templates from [@nglaser3]
- Unit tests for distribution sampling from [@massimolarsen]

### Changed

- Redesigned weight window implementation from [@nglaser3]
- Numba-optimized visualizer from [@gunnarrl]
- Documentation updates from [@melekderman]

### Removed

The following features were temporarily removed during the refactor:

- Domain decomposition
- iQMC
- UQ
- Compressed sensing
- Branchless collision
- Derivative Source Method
- Initial Condition bank

The pre-refactor implementation remains available in the `cement` branch as a reference for these features. They will be reintroduced incrementally in future releases.

### Fixed

- Multi-table distribution table selection sampling from [@melekderman]
