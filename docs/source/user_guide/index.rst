User Guide
==========

The User Guide provides task-oriented instructions for building, running, and
analyzing MC/DC simulations. It begins with an introduction for new users and
then covers modeling, execution, examples, and troubleshooting.

For exact class and method signatures, use the :doc:`../reference/index`.

Getting Started
---------------

New to MC/DC? Begin here to understand the project, install the package, and
complete your first transport calculation.

Modeling and Results
--------------------

Follow :doc:`simulation_lifecycle` for the complete construct, compile,
visualize, execute, and post-process workflow. Use
:doc:`iterative_simulations` when several runs reuse most of a model while
changing selected inputs.
