Sphere-in-Cube Fission Detector
=============================================

Problem Description
===================

A three-dimensional time-dependent problem with a homogeneous fissile
sphere embedded inside a scattering cube.  A cell-based tally records
the fission rate inside the sphere, demonstrating MC/DC's **cell tally**
functionality.

Geometry and Materials
======================

The computational domain is a cube:
:math:`x,y,z \in [0,4]` cm, with vacuum boundary conditions.

A sphere of radius 1.5 cm is centred at :math:`(2,2,2)` cm.

Physical Assumptions
====================

* Mono-energetic (one-speed) neutron transport.
* Isotropic scattering (cube) and isotropic fission (sphere).
* Time-dependent transport with a uniform isotropic source,
  :math:`t \in [0,50]` s.
* Implicit capture variance-reduction technique.

Quantities of Interest
======================

* Volume-integrated fission rate inside the sphere.
* Statistical uncertainty (standard deviation) of the cell tally.

Reference Solution
==================

The problem can be verified analytically for simple cross-section
combinations using first-flight collision probabilities.

Step-by-Step Walkthrough
========================

**1. Import and Materials (lines 1–12)**

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/sphere_in_cube/input.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-12
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:

Two mono-energetic materials: a purely fissile material (``pure_f``,
:math:`\Sigma_f = 1.0`, :math:`\nu = 1.2`) for the sphere, and a purely
scattering material (``pure_s``, :math:`\Sigma_s = 1.0`) for the cube.

**2. Surfaces and CSG Regions (lines 14–26)**

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/sphere_in_cube/input.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 14-26
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:

Six planes define the cube, and a ``Sphere`` surface defines the
detector region.  The ``~`` (complement) operator carves out the
sphere from the cube.

**3. Source (lines 32–39)**

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/sphere_in_cube/input.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 32-39
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:

A uniform isotropic source fills the cube over :math:`t \in [0,50]` s.

**4. Cell Tally, Settings, and Run (lines 45–55)**

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/sphere_in_cube/input.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 45-55
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:

This example uses cell-filtered ``Tally`` — it tallies fission events inside a
specific cell (the sphere) rather than on a spatial mesh.
Implicit capture is enabled to keep particles alive longer.

**What to try:**

- Replace the cell filter with a mesh filter to visualise the 3-D flux.
- Change the sphere radius or :math:`\nu` to see how fission rate changes.
- Add a time grid to the cell tally for time-resolved data.
- Change the cell-filtered current scores to ``["current-net", "current-in", "current-out"]``
  to score current across the sphere cell boundary.
