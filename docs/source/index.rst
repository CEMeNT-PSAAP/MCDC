=================================
MC/DC: Monte Carlo Dynamic Code
=================================

MC/DC is a performant, scalable, and machine-portable Python-based 
Monte Carlo neutron transport software in active development.
It supports fully transient (aka dynamic) Monte Carlo transport and implements
novel methods and algorithms for neutron transport. MC/DC is purpose built to be
a rapid methods development platform for for modern HPCs and is targeting CPUs and GPUs.

MC/DC has support for continuous energy and multi-group transport.
It can solve more traditional k-eigenvalue problems (used to determine neutron population growth rates in reactors) as well as fully dynamic simulations.
It has a novel continuous geometry movement function that models transient elements (*e.g.*, control rods or pulsed neutron experiments) more accurately than the step functions used by other codes.
It also supports some simple Domain decomposition, with more complex algorithms currently being implemented.

MC/DC is machine portable and is validated to run on:

* linux-64 (x86)
* osx-64 (x86, intel based macs)
* osx-arm64 (apple silicon based macs)
* linux-ppc64 (IBM POWER9)
* linux-nvidia-cuda
* win-64 (runs but not recommend!)

Primary development is done by the `Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport <https://cement-psaap.github.io/>`_ (CEMeNT).
