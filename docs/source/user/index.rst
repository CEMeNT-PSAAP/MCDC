User's Guide
============

We include a simple "first simulation guide" as well as more in-depth descriptions on how to execute MC/DC in compiled modes to CPUs and GPUs with or without MPI.

These instructions all assume you have an operable and working version of MC/DC installed in an appropriate environment for your system.
