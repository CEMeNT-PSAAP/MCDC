Theory Guide
============

We provided a brief theory guide into some of the novel functions and features in MC/DC.
Both for algorithms and simulation/compilation schemes.

For a more basic primer of Monte Carlo neutron transport and methods we suggest exploring the `OpenMC theory guide <https://docs.openmc.org/en/latest/methods/index.html>`_ .
