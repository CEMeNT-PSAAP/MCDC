	abstract = {Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientiﬁc and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into eﬃcient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are at the heart of many high-fidelity simulations and analyses for radiation transport systems. As is the case with any complex computational model, it is important to propagate sources of input uncertainty and characterize how they affect model output. Unfortunately, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is made difficult by the stochastic variability that Monte Carlo transport solvers introduce. The standard method to avoid corrupting the UQ statistics with the transport solver noise is to increase the number of particle histories, resulting in very high computational costs. In this contribution, we propose and analyze a sampling estimator based on the law of total variance to compute UQ variance even in the presence of residual noise from Monte Carlo transport calculations. We rigorously derive the statistical properties of the new variance estimator, compare its performance to that of the standard method, and demonstrate its use on neutral particle transport model problems involving both attenuation and scattering physics. We illustrate, both analytically and numerically, the estimator’s statistical performance as a function of available computational budget and the distribution of that budget between UQ samples and particle histories. We show analytically and corroborate numerically that the new estimator is unbiased, unlike the standard approach, and is more accurate and precise than the standard estimator for the same computational budget.},

	abstract = {A continuous-energy Monte Carlo neutron transport solver executing on GPUs has been developed within the Shift code. Several algorithmic approaches are considered, including both history-based and event-based implementations. Unlike in previous work involving multigroup Monte Carlo transport, it is demonstrated that event-based algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform a historybased approach for continuous-energy transport as a result of increased device occupancy and reduced thread divergence. Numerical results are presented for detailed full-core models of a small modular reactor (SMR), including a model containing depleted fuel materials. These results demonstrate the substantial gains in performance that are possible with the latest-generation of GPUs. On the depleted SMR core conﬁguration, an NVIDIA P100 GPU with 56 streaming multiprocessors provides performance equivalent to 90 CPU cores, and the latest V100 GPU with 80 multiprocessors oﬀers the performance of more than 150 CPU cores.},
